# An example SquAd environments file.
#
# It provides all the connection details for one or more Squonk2 environments.
# It is expected to be found in the user's home directory
# as '~/.squad/environments' or the user can 'point' to it by setting
# 'SQUAD_ENVIRONMENT_FILE', e.g. 'export SQUAD_ENVIRONMENT_FILE=~/my-env'

# The 'environments' block defines one or more environments.
# Each has a name. Here we define an environment 'default' but environments
# can be called anything. Restrict your names to letters and hyphens only.
environments:
  default:
    # The hostname of the keycloak server, without a 'http' prefix
    # or a '/auth' suffix.
    keycloak-hostname: example.com
    # The realm name used for the Squonk2 environment.
    keycloak-realm: squonk2
    # The client IDs of the Account Server and Data Manager
    keycloak-as-client-id: account-server-api
    keycloak-dm-client-id: data-manager-api
    # The hostnames of the Account Server and Data Manager,
    # without a 'http' prefix or api suffix.
    as-hostname: example.com
    dm-hostname: example.com
    # The username and password of a user for the Account Server and
    # Data Manager. The user *MUST* have admin rights.
    # or api suffix.
    user: dlister
    password: blob1234

# The final part of the file is an environment property,
# which SquAd uses to select the appropriate environment from the block above.
# It's simply the name of one of the environment above.
environment: default
